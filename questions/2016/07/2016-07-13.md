## Cookie

HTTP is a stateless protocol, but there are many situations where we need to get stateful infomation...Cookies were designed for this to be *a reliable mechanism for websibites to remember stateful information*.

A cookie is a small piece of data **sent from a website and stored in the user's web browser** while the user is browsing.

### Expires & Max-Age

* `Expires` defines a specific date and time when the user agent should delete the cookie, with the format `Wdy, DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT`.
* If `Expires` defines a date in the past, the user agent will *delete it right away*.
* `Max-Age` defines the cookie's expiration as an interval of seconds in the future relative to the time the browser received the cookie.
* Cookies without `Expires` and `Max-Age` will be set as **session cookies**, it will be *deleted after the user closes their user agents (browser)*.

### Domain & Path

* `Domain` and `Path` define the scope of the cookie. If not specified by the server, they default to the domain (not including sub domains) and path of the requested resource.
* `Domain` can **only** be set on *the current resource's top domain and its sub domains*.

### Secure & HttpOnly

* `Secure` and `HttpOnly` are flags indicating the behaviors the cookie should be enabled.
* `Secure` defines whether the cookie communication should be *limited to encryted transmission* (HTTPS), directing user agents to use cookies **only via secure/encrypted connections**.
* `HttpOnly` directs the user agent *not to expose cookies through channels other than HTTP(S) requests*. If enabled, the cookie **cannot be accessed via client-side scripting languages (JavaScript)**, which can avoid XSS partly.

### Limit

The user agents should provide:

* **at least** 4096 bytes per cookie
* at least 50 cookies per domain
* at least 3000 cookies total

### How

Add fields in HTTP header.

1. Server :arrow_right: User Agent

    ```bnf
    Set-Cookie: key=value[; Expires=date][; Max-Age=seconds][; Domain=domain][; Path=path][; Secure][; HttpOnly]
    ```

2. User Agent :arrow_right: Server

    ```bnf
    Cookie: key=value
    ```

### Third-Party Cookie

A web page may contain images or other components stored on servers in other domains (advertisements or something). Cookies that are set during retrieval of these components are called **third-party cookies**. These cookies can be used to track a user across multiple sites by advertsing companies (where they placed the advertising components).

### Cookies Theft && Session Hijacking

* Network Eavesdropping (Man-in-the-Middle Attack)
* DNS Cache Poisoning (publishing false sub-domain)
* XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
* CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

Details in the future. :joy:

## Session

Sessions are **server-side** files / data that contain user information. Sessions have a unique ID that maps them to specific users. This ID can be passed in the URL or saved into a session cookie.

### Session ID

> A session token is a unique identifier that is generated and sent from a server to a client to identify the current interaction session. The client usually stores and sends the token as an **HTTP cookie** and/or sends it as **a parameter in GET or POST queries**.

> The reason to use session tokens is that the client only has to handle the identifierâ€”**all session data is stored on the server** (usually in a database, to which the client does not have direct access) linked to that identifier.

## Web Storage

The **Web Storage API** provides mechanisms by which **browsers** can store key/value pairs, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies.

* `sessionStorage` maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's **available for the duration of the page session** (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores)
* `localStorage` does the same thing, but **persists even when the browser is closed and reopened**.

### Usage

```javascript
window.addEventListener('storage', (e) => console.log(e))

localStorage.setItem('local', 1)
localStorage.getItem('local') // 1
localStorage.removeItem('local')
localStorage.getItem('local') // null
localStorage.clear() // remove all items
```

## Differences

| | Cookie | Session | localStorage | sessionStorage |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Where | Client | Server | Client | Client |
| How | HTTP Header / JS | Session ID | - | - |
| API | document.cookie | Depend on server | Web Storage API | Web Storage API |
| Size | >= 4KB | no limit (Server) | Vary between | browsers |
| Expire | expires & max-age | Page duration | Forever (removeItem / clear) | Page duration |
