## var

### Scope

As we all know, there isn't **block-level scope** but **function-level scope** in JavaScript.

For example:

```javascript
var scope = 'outer scope'
{
  var scope = 'inner scope'
  console.log(scope) // inner scope
}
console.log(scope) // inner scope

function foo() {
  var scope = 'function scope';
  console.log(scope) // function scope
}
foo()
console.log(scope) // inner scope
```

### Hoisting

Moreover, declaring a variable at anywhere is equivalent to delcaring it at the top (of the function or global) in JavaScript, which is called **hoisting**.

For example:

```javascript
console.log(a) // undefined
var a = 1
;(function () {
  if (!a) console.log(a) // undefined, since a has been hoisted
  var a = 2
  console.log(a) // 2
})()
```

## let and const

### scope

ECMAScript 2015 (aka ES6) introduced two ways to declare block-level scope local variables: `let` and `const`. `let`'s function is likes `var`, and `const` declares **read-only value**.

```javascript
let scope = 'outer scope'
{
  let scope = 'inner scope'
  console.log(scope) // inner scope
}
console.log(scope) // outer scope
```

### Hoisting

Variables declared by `let` and `const` **will also be hoisted to the top of the blocks**. But unlike `var`, referencing the variables declared by `let` and `const` before their declarations will result in a `ReferenceError` because of the **TDZ** (Temporal Dead Zone, the region of a program, where a variable or a parameter **cannot be accessed until itâ€™s initialized**).

The [specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-let-and-const-declarations) says:

> let and const declarations define variables that are scoped to the running execution context's **LexicalEnvironment**. The variables are created when their containing Lexical Environment is instantiated **but may not be accessed in any way until the variable's LexicalBinding is evaluated**. A variable defined by a LexicalBinding with an Initializer is assigned the value of its Initializer's AssignmentExpression **when the LexicalBinding is evaluated, not when the variable is created**. If a LexicalBinding in a let declaration does not have an Initializer the variable is assigned the value undefined when the LexicalBinding is evaluated.

Examples:

```javascript
let a = 1
{
  // ReferenceError
  // Because `let a` has been hoisted but cannot be referenced
  console.log(a)
  let a = 2
}

// equivalent to: let b = undefined, so can be referenced from now on
let b

// ReferenceError
// Assignment happens when the LexicalBinding is evaluated
// However, right-side c is hoisted and under TDZ now...
let c = c

function tdz (x = y, y) {
  console.log(x, y)
}
tdz(undefined, 1) // ReferenceError, y is not defined

let q = 1
function tdz2 (p = q, q) {
  console.log(p, q)
}
tdz2(undefined, 2) // Still ReferenceError, q is not defined
// Default parameters are evaluated in an intermediate scope
// In which, p = q will resolve q in the intermediate scope,
// but q cannot be referenced until it's initialized
```

BTW, TDZ is not implemented in most transpilers (like babel, traceur), [an issue](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/issues/1382). :cold_sweat:
