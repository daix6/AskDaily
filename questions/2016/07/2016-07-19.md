question: How to get nth fibonacci number in JavaScript?

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

## A simple version

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n < 0) throw Error('Wrong arguments! Natural numbers only!')
  return n < 2 ? n : fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
}

fibonacci(50)
```

The simplest version takes many unnecessary caculations during the process. There are many redundancy in the `fibonacci(n-1)` and `fibonacci(n-2)`.

This kind of recursion is called **tree recursion**. How about doing the recursion linearly?

## Linear Recursion

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n < 0) throw Error('Wrong arguments! Natural numbers only!')
  else {
    function iter(cur, next, count) {
      if (count === 0) return cur
      return iter(next, cur + next, count--)
    }

    return iter(0, 1, n)
  }
}
```

By this way, the recursion becames linear with **O(n)** time complexity. It's much faster than the tree recursion version. The reason behind it is that it always cache the latest two result which the *tree recursion* does not.

How about we create a Map that cache the result of n once we caculate it?

## Memoization

```javascript
let fibonacci = (function() {
  let memo = {}

  return function f(n) {
    if (n < 0) throw Error('Wrong arguments! Natural numbers only!')
    else {
      if (n in memo) return memo[n]
      else {
        let cache;
        if (n < 2) cache = n
        else cache = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)
        memo[n] = cache
        return memo[n]
      }
    }
  }
})()
```

In this implementation, it caches every caculated fibonacci(n) in `memo`, which provides better performance than the simplest version. But it takes more spaces than the linear recursion because of the `memo`.

All of the above implementation will throw `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` when n is quite big. So why don't we try to make use of iteration?

## Iteration

```javascript
function fibonacci (n) {
  if (n < 0) throw Error('Wrong arguments! Natural numbers only!')
  let cur = 0, next = 1

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)
    [cur, next] = [next, cur + next]

  return cur
}
```

By this way, there won't be `RangeError` any more!

## Benchmark

There is my different implementations: [fibonacci.js](https://github.com/daix6/AskDaily/tree/master/examples/fibonacci.js).

The picture below shows the performance of different implementations.

## Have Fun

ES6 introduced generators. Try fibonacci with generator: :laughing:

```javascript
function* fibonacci () {
  let a = 0
  let b = 1
  yield a
  yield b
  while (true) {
    [a, b] = [b, a + b]
    yield b
  }
}

let gen = fibonacci() // Infinite fibonacci number generator!
gen.next().value // Use this to get next fibonacci number

```
