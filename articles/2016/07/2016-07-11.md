question: How does the browser downloads resources from a web page?

## Example

With a html like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Test</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style1.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style2.css" media="print">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Content.... -->
  <img src="image.png" alt="Image">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="script1.js" async></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="script2.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

1. The browser begins to parse the html file, and construct the DOM tree.
    1. Meets `style1.css`: Download this file, and keep constructing the DOM tree.
    2. Meets `style2.css`: Download this file, and keep constructing the DOM tree.
    3. Meets `image.png`: Download this file, and keep constructing the DOM tree.
    4. Meets `script1.js`: Download this file, and keep constructing the DOM tree.
    5. Meets `script2.js`: Download this file, and **stop DOM tree's construction**.
    6. All files' (except `script2.js`) downloading will be parallel (within the limit of browser).
2. After `script2.js` has finished downloading, browser will delay the script's execution until `style1.css` has finished downloading and constructing the CSSOM. (DOM tree construction is **still blocked now**).
3. Once `script2.js`s execution finished, the browser will continue to construct the DOM tree.
4. The browser will construct the render tree (combine DOM and CSSOM) once all **critical resources** like `style1.css`, `script2.js` here) have been processed.
5. After `style2.css` has finished downloading, the browser begin parse it.
6. After `script1.js` has finished downloading:
    * if DOM is under construction, then block the DOM construction and excute the script
    * if `DOMContentLoaded`, then just excute it...
7. The browser will trigger `DOMContentedLoaded` event once the DOM tree's construction completed.
8. The browser will trigger `load` event once all resources(*images, stylesheets, scripts*) have been downloaded and processed.

### Why

1. **style1.css** and **script2.js** won't influence the DOM and the render process.
    * `media='print'` means it will be used only when **print** it.
    * `async` implies it does not process the DOM at all
2. Scripts's downloading (not async) and execution will block the DOM tree's construction.
3. Scripts's excution must wait until all essential stylesheets have been parsed.
4. The browser will trigger [`DOMContentedLoaded`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded) event once the DOM tree's construction completed.
5. The browser will trigger [`load`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/load) event once all resources (*images, stylesheets, scripts, ...*) have been downloaded and processed.
