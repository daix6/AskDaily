question: What are multipart/form-data and application/x-www-form-urlencoded?
tags: HTTP, POST
---

Both of them are the optional values of `enctype` where the `<form>` element specifies the *content type* used to encode the form data set for submission to the server. There are three choices:

1. application/x-www-form-urlencoded (default)
2. multipart/form-data
3. text/plain

### application/x-www-form-urlencoded

1. Just like a querystring: `name=John+Smith&age=27`;
2. Each character that cannot be expressed using the selected character encoding, replacing the character by a string like `&#xxxx;` where `xxxx` means the *Unicode code point* of the character in base 10. ([NCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_character_reference));
3. Replace `0x20` (space) the byte by `+`;
4. Leave characters match `/[\*\-\.0-9A-Z_a-z]/` (**alphanumeric**) as is;
5. Otherwise, replace the byte (**non-alphanumeric**) by `%HH` (must be two) where `HH` means the *uppsercase ASCII hex digits* representing the byte.

### multipart/form-data

Talk is cheap, show you the code:

```html
<form enctype='multipart/form-data' method='POST' action='test'>
  <input type='file' name='file' value='千本桜.txt'/>
  <input type='text' name='text' value='John Smith' />
  <input type='submit' name='submit' value='Submit Button' />
</form>
```

The corresponding HTTP request would like this:

![multipart/form-data](images/multipart-form-data.png)

The `boundary` in the `Content-Type` works just like the `&` in querystring, but its value shall never appear in the entries (key and value).

The `name` in the `Content-Disposition` is the same as the entry's name.

### text/plain

Do not use.

> Payloads using the text/plain format are intended to be human readable. They are not reliably interpretable by computer, as the format is ambiguous (for example, there is no way to distinguish a literal newline in a value from the newline at the end of the value).

## Application

> If you have binary (non-alphanumeric) data (or a significantly sized payload) to transmit, use `multipart/form-data`. Otherwise, use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

BTW, if you are using `ajax`, there are more choices for you. Like **application/json**, **application/xml**...
