question: List of Cache-Related HTTP Header Fields?
tags: HTTP, Cache-Control, Deprecated

(Personally, this answer is totally a mess :rage::rage::rage:, I may rewrite it some day...:disappointed_relieved::sob:)

### Cache-Control (Response Header Mainly)

1. What's cacheable
    * `public`: This resource is cacheable by clients and shared (proxy) cache. Better for resources that **everybody** can access.
    * `private`: Default. Only cacheable by clients and not by shared (proxy) cache. Better for resources intended **for only one user**.
    * `no-cache`: Do not use the cache to satisfy subsequent requests without **succesful revalidation** with the origin server (every time).  
    If this directives specify field-names, the cache can be used to satisfy subsequent requests but *the specified field-names should be stripped out (like cookies)* without succesful revalidation with the origin server.
2. What may be stored by caches
    * `no-store`: Do not store any part of this request (or response). Designed for sensitive information requirements.
3. The expiration mechanism
    * `max-age`: Imply the response is cacheable unless other more restrictive cache directive is also present. `max-age` **directive overrides** `Expires` **header**.
    * `s-maxage`: For **shared** cache (CDN), the maximum age specified by this directive will override `max-age` directive and `Expires` header. If this cache becomes stale, must revalidate it when respond to a subsequent request. If `private`, this will be ignored.
4. Cache revalidation and reload controls
    * `must-revalidate`: Revalidate the resource on any subsequent request every time and not serve stale content.  
    * `proxy-revalidate`: Similar to `must-revalidate`, except that it does not apply to non-shared user agent caches.
5. `no-transform`: The cache or proxy must not change any aspect of the entity-body that is specified by these headers, including the value of the entity-body itself.
6. Cache control extensions: Unrecognized directives will be ignored.

### ETag (Entity Tag)

A unique identifier for the requested resource, typically the hash of the resource or the hash of the timestamp the resource was updated. It can be used to validate the entry.

### Expires

The date/time after which the response is considered stale. A stale cache entry may not normally be returned by a ache unless it's first validated with the origin server.

### Last-Modified

The date/time at which the origin server believes the resource was last modified.

### If-Modified-Since (Request)

If the requested variant has not been modified since the time specified in this field, an entity will not be returned from the server; instead, a **304 response will be returned** without any message-body.

`If-Unmodified-Since` works like `If-Modified-Since` except the condition is opposite.

### If-None-Match (Request)

If any of the entity tags match the entity tag of the requested resource, the server should return 304.

`If-Match` works like `If-None-Match` except the condition is opposite.
